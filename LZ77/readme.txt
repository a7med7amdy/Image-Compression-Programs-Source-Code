-this is the code of LZ77 encoding and decoding.
-the folders which carries the names of the pic are containing
the encoded file and the decoded one for each m.
-there's a script here to run the commands from it only write ./hw1_p3.sh
and it'll run all the commands which are:-
1-encode image
2-decode image
3-encode decorrelated diff in image
4-decode it
then the images the encoding first then the decoding after it ordered as:-
1-msg1
2-msg2
3-msg3
4-earth
5-omaha
6-sena
7-sensin

--->>decorrelated images are the images which its pixels is subtracted from the left one except for the first at each row.
-->>>>in the encoded file, there's a number at the top indicates the no. of bits.
-when it asks you to press any key press it then you'll wait for 3s.
-there's a delay 10s between each command if you want to change it just
change the hw1_p2.sh extension to .txt -> change the 10s to any other.

--->>>if it gives you an error , re run it again (type it again) and it'll work 
this happens due to the id error of .exe found already.
