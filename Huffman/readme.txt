-this is the code of Huffman encoding.
-there's a script here to run the commands from it only write ./hw1_p1.sh
and it'll run all the commands which are:-
1-entropy
2-tree
3-encoding
4-encoding -diff
then the images the encoding first then the decoding after it ordered as:-
1-msg1
2-msg2
3-msg3
4-earth
5-omaha
6-sena
7-sensin
-there's a delay 5s between each block of commands related to one bec if you want to change it just
change the hw1_p2.sh extension to .txt -> change the 5s to any other.

--->>>if it gives you an error , re run it again (type it again) and it'll work 
this happens due to the id error of .exe found already.
