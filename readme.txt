-in each folder there's a read me file describes what's done in each one
-all the images are decoded and encoded by resolution as it's given as if i takes .pgm file 
has resolution 256 256 , then i print it as this. 
i prefered to inform you as when you move on my decoded file or encoded you can know and visualize the difference
between the real image and mine.
so there's few images if you want to see it by image.pgm iewer, my images wouldn't five good image for you
as it's resolution differ from the real one "i made it as i take it from pgm file
