-this is the code of arithmetic encoding and decoding.
-the folders which carries the names of the pic which are compressed are containing
samples the encoded file and the decoded one for each m.
-there's a script here to run the commands from it only write ./hw1_p2.sh
and it'll run all the commands which are:-
1-bin to dec 0x80000000
2-dec to bin 0.5
then the images the encoding first then the decoding after it ordered as:-
1-earth
2-omaha
3-sena
4-sensin
-when it asks you to press any key press it then you'll wait for 10s.
-there's a delay 10s between each command if you want to change it just
change the hw1_p2.sh extension to .txt -> change the 10s to any other.

--->>>if it gives you an error , re run it again (type it again) and it'll work 
this happens due to the id error of .exe found already.
